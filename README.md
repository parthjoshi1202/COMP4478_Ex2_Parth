In this game we use Prefabs of fish and bomb sprites as well as a net to collect them. 
The user can go left and right using left and right arrow keys to move the net and collect fishes to continue playing the game. 
Each fish earns the user 1 point. If the user collects a bomb in the net, the game is over and the game restarts in 3 seconds. 
The user can keep a track of the score using the score displayed on the screen.
